Quick Food is a responsive and modern food delivery platform designed to help local food vendors, home chefs, and small restaurants who are unable to onboard on platforms like Zomato or Swiggy. 🌍
This project gives them a digital presence and helps them reach customers in their local area with ease and simplicity. 💡
